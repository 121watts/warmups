# Equality

*highest standard
*pain in TDD

def test_i_win
  game = Game.new
  assert_equal "Hooray! You Win!", game.win
end

def test_i_won
  game = Game.new
  assert_equal "hooray! you win!", game.win.downcase
end

*provides some flexibility but still not good enout

##More Flexibility

def test_i_have_won
  game = Game.new
  assert game.win.include?("win")
end

# Using Regular Expressions

````ruby
def test_i_win_with_guess_count
  game = Game.new
  game.guess("asdf")
  game.guess("dfer")

  #Check that game win message
  #has a count of turns

  assert_equal 2, game.win
end
